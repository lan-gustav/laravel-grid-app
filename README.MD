# Grids Application

This is a sample app developed to showcase how the `leantony/laravel-grid` package works. The package
is still not yet available on packagist, but a preview version of the same is at `leantony/laravel_grid`

This app shall be deployed to heroku soon enough

If you wanna try the grids package for yourself, run `composer require leantony/laravel_grid:dev-master`. 
As much as it is stable, it has not been documented properly yet.
